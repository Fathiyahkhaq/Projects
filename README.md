# Portfolio 
Welcome to my project portfolio!    
I share all the projects I made in field of Data Science and Analytics problems   
These are all projects I made while studying in Hacktiv8 on batch 009 Fulltime Data Science Program

## **Clickbait Detection** — [deployment](https://clicbait-detection.herokuapp.com/)
> Python: Tensorflow, NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, Flask, pickle
- Text categorization for detection clickbait headlines using Recurrent Neural Network
- Compared model Deep Neural Network, LSTM and GRU
- Model Performance : Accuracy 97% (GRU as best model)

## **Customer Segmentation** 
> Python: scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly,seaborn, pandas
- Clustering bank customer segmentation
- Feature reduced using PCA (80% information included)
- Compared model K-means, DBScan and Spectral Clustering

## **Car Price Prediction** — [deployment](https://harga-mobil-fathiyah.herokuapp.com/)
> Python: scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, Flask, pickle
- Predicting Car Price using Random Forest Regressor
- Compared with Linear, Ridge, Lasso,  Polynomial Regression and Decision Tree Regressor
- Model Performance: 0.93 (R2) & 0.09 (MAPE)

## **Churn Customer Prediction** — [deployment](https://churn-m1-fath.herokuapp.com/)
> Python: Tensorflow, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask, pickle
